Caused by mutations in the PIK3CA gene. This gene provides instructions for making the p110 alpha (p110伪) protein, which is a subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The PIK3CA gene mutations associated with Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome alter the p110伪 protein. The altered subunit makes PI3K abnormally active, which allows cells to grow and divide continuously. Increased cell proliferation leads to abnormal growth of the bones, soft tissues, and blood vessels. This syndrome is almost always sporadic meaning it can occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Studies suggest that the condition results from gene mutations that are not inherited.	900000000000017005

The growth effect may be manifested in only one bone (mainly the femur or tibia) or, in some cases, affect the whole limb. The existence of arteriovenous fistulas around or inside the bone is now being widely accepted as the main cause of bone overgrowth.

Bone marrow failure, fractures and visual impairment are the classical features of the disease, which begins in early infancy or in fetal life. It results from the failure of osteoclasts to resorb immature bone. This leads to abnormal bone marrow cavity formation and to the clinical signs and symptoms of bone marrow failure. It is accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly due to compensatory extramedullary hematopoiesis. The disease is heterogeneous. Over 50% of cases are due to mutations in the TCIRG1 gene and another 10% are due to mutations in the CLCN7 gene. A small number of patients have been described with mutations in the OSTM1 gene. Transmission is autosomal recessive.	900000000000017005

The rash rapidly progresses to become vesicular and bullous on the face and body. High fever is a constant feature. Two thirds of cases are triggered by a drug allergy. In rare cases, the disease is associated with infections or bone marrow transplantation. The remaining 25-30% of cases are classed as idiopathic.

The presence of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) in more than 70% of cases suggests an autoimmune pathogenesis. GAD-Abs may block synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) thereby attenuating inhibition of spinal motoneurones.	900000000000017005
